# Java
Java is an object-oriented programming language and a platform developed by Sun Microsystems (eaten by Oracle). Using the principle of **WORA** (Write Once, Run Anywhere), a Java application can be compiled and executed on any platform supported by Java. Flexible, popular, and well-supported, Java has helps developers write scalable client-server web applications, desktop and mobile applications, and frameworks and libraries.

## Features
- **Platform independence** The compiler converts source code to bytecode, then the JVM executes that bytecode. While each operating system has their own JVM implementation, so every JVM can execute bytecode regardless of origin of said code.

- **Clear, verbose syntax** Java has C-like syntax like C++ and C#, many syntax elements of the language are readable and widely used in programming. The Java API (Application Programming Interface) is also written using verbose, descriptive naming conventions making it simple to parse large code bases.

- **Multi-paradigm** While Java is object-oriented, it supports multiple paradigms such as imperative, generic, concurrent, and functional.

- **Garbage collection** The JVM performs automatic memory deallocation of unused objects at runtime. Programs are written without the need for complex memory management.

- **Multithreading** Java supports multithreading at both language and the standard library levels. It allows concurrent and parallel execution of several parts of a Java program.

## Programming and Compiling
Most Java applications only require the **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment). But to write and compile you need the **JDK** (Java Development Kit). While the JRE provides Java's standard libraries and exceptions as well as a JVM, the JDK provides all the above as well as *javac*, the compiler. Java source code is written in text files labeled with *.java* extension. It is then compiled into bytecode in *.class* files by *javac*. Then the bytecode is executed by the JVM, which translates the Java commands into low-level instructions to the operating system.

Since Java 6, all Java programs not run inside a container (such as a Servlet Web Container) start and end with the main method. The class containing the main method can have any name, but the method itself should always be named *main*

```java
class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Num args:" + args.length);
    }
}
```

- *public* is a Java access modifier keyword that means the `main` method can be accessed from any method during the program's execution.
- *static* is a Java keyword that means the method can be invoked without creating an instance of the class that contains it, making it a global method.
- *void* is a Java return type keyword that means the method doesn't return any values of any data type.
- *args* is a Java variable of type String array which means the method can take command line arguments as an array of Strings

We can compile this code into a *.class* file of the same name:
>javac Example.java

And to run the resulting `Example.class` file:
>java Example

The `java` and `javac` commands require the full directory path or class path to any source code or binary file respectively. If you have a package `com.demo` in the first line of Example, then you would nest the java file into a `com/demo/` directory and then run:
>javac com/demo/Example.java 

>java com.demo.Example

From here we can add packages and imports, expanding the application into a set of interacting objects. By default, the *javac* compiler implicitly imports several base packages from the standard library. the `-help` flag can display available options. For example, the following will compile using UTF-8 encoding while conforming to Java 1.8 features:
>javac -encoding UTF-8 -source 8 -target 8 Example.java
